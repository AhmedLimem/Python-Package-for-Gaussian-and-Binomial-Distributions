# Python Package for Gaussian and Binomial Distributions

We will assume that you are familiar with the Statistics concepts, especially [Gaussian Distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution) and [Binomial Distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution).  

We will include the following features:
  * Read in dataset
  * Calculate mean
  * Calculate standard deviation
  * Plot histogram
  * Plot probability density function
  * Add two distributions
